       <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A <a href><img class="img-ab" src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/1209485-200.png">fruit</a> results from <a href>maturation</a> of one or more flowers, and the gynoecium of the flower(s) forms all or part of the fruit.[10]
            Inside the ovary/ovaries are one or more ovules where the megagametophyte contains the egg cell.After double <a href>fertilization</a>, these ovules will become seeds. The ovules are fertilized in a process that starts with <a href>pollination</a>, which involves the movement of pollen from the <a href>stamens</a> to the stigma of flowers. After <a href>pollination</a>, a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the megagametophyte. Within the megagametophyte one of the two sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote, and the second sperm enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell, which completes the double fertilization process.[12][13] Later the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed, and the endosperm mother cell will give rise to endosperm, a nutritive tissue used by the embryo.

              <p> Plant scientists have grouped fruits into three main groups, simple fruits, aggregate fruits, and composite or multiple fruits.[15] The groupings are not evolutionarily relevant, since many diverse plant taxa may be in the same group, but reflect how the flower organs are arranged and how the fruits develop.
                Aggregate fruits form from single flowers that have multiple carpels which are not joined together, i.e. each pistil contains one carpel. Each pistil forms a fruitlet, and collectively the fruitlets are called an etaerio. Four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes, follicles, drupelets, and berries. Ranunculaceae species, including Clematis and Ranunculus have an etaerio of achenes, Calotropis has an etaerio of follicles, and Rubus species like raspberry.</p>
